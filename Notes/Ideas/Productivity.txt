	Setup

To maximise productivity, be hikikomori [?], leave apartment 0, work 18 hours per day. I am executing this .txt program. I use local files and Visual Studio Code/Chrome for nearly everything. My file organisation is reflected in my Github, I have unshared files locally. See after for further details.

	Calendar

Mine is a .txt file which works across devices. I can always see years ahead and remove pending items upon completion. Can include air filter replacement, rent, interviews, tests, groceries, upcoming Amazon purchases, etc. The first lines can contain daily reminders. Example:

"
Challenge yourself with increasingly complex structure and intelligence.
Do not cry, do not be angry, focus work work work work keep on pumping out high quality useful helpful insights.

[?] I love you, how are you feeling, what are your plans, what are you curious about [to girlfriend/wife/child]?

[Of course during nightly petting tell her you love her very much and she makes you feel very good and happy "good girl" whatever if she likes that.]

SDS323 MW [15] UGS303 T/Th[15:30] F[12]

03-01		Air Filter
03-07	17	Test Game Theory
03-10		Bills
03-24		Rent
"

One may even record their responses, plan accordingly, and ensure to follow up later.

	Text Or LaTeX Everything

It is critical to record ideas, so that one can review them later. And the grading boost. The transition cost is low, and this habit yields massive upside. By "everything", I really mean everything! I suggest Googling ~ "GOV312 Exam 3 Quizlet" then [ctrl a] [ctrl c] [ctrl v] the 3 most recently published relevant Quizlets into a .txt file. Study this for 1 hour each day for 3 days leading in to the test with the completed review sheet also in a .txt file. This way, maybe obtain an A with a total of <20 hours of labour. One can sometimes utilise the replace all function in Visual Studio Code and turn a .mobi or .pdf into a .txt file. I pick the best looking file from Library Genesis. Also, I have all my school work saved. Everything is backed up on a Drive.

Chronic Exposure To Notes
Dramatically improves learning and retention. When solving, many moving parts seem routine.

Brainstorming
Sometimes initial ideas are wrong and seemingly stupid ideas are right.

Writing And Emails
Draft and contemplate prior to pushing. Simple, simple, simple, emphatic, assertive, 5 sentences or less, terse, actionable, important, key ideas, technical, anticipate cruxes, already defended rather than defensible. Compose in text editor, tank for >10 minutes, contemplate, query around to form an up to date model of the reader who is gazing upon the text file you cause to appear in front of their eyes and perhaps annoy them with a notification ping. Email girls at most 1 time [concrete date plan, real life or Instant Messaging session, or potential plans] and never chain, limit to 1 email per day otherwise. Do not send emails to people who ask, clearly or implicitly by not responding or bouncing back, for you not to. Email 1 person at a time or Blind Carbon Copy. To correct False information errors, post technical documentation in a public comment. Set up an automatic forwarding system to/or store all emails in a folder and locally and backed up. Optimise all outgoing signals in order to obtain desired goals target outcomes. Do not push between 20:00 and 08:00. Scheduled emails exist. Do not post the names of coworkers, relatively private individuals, citizens, intellectuals in public. Provide source texts and/or links perhaps to Internet Archive. Ensure to not ruffle the feathers of coworkers or bother/annoy/miff girls at a firm. Probably a policy of using only exclusively first names for all coworkers including bosses. No "messieur", "dottore", "brain organ", "brother", "executing whining computations", animals, swearing, "retarded", offensive, etc. I might even try very hard to full on omit all pronouns like "he/she" from my writing in fact use exclusively first names if possible from now on. Apparently this style of writing is dominant and in fashion nowadays and perhaps from hereon out. Omit jokes, metaphors, isms, references. This includes strings such as "Red pill" which have yet to Truly enter the lexicon or add value in a meaningful way.

Drafting Weeks In Advance
Then one has follow on and spin off ideas.

Lists
For the Putnam, I created a list of topics I knew I needed to cover and understand deeply to maximise my performance.

Homework Writing
Include task details like "definition X" and "for matrix $A=\begin{bmatrix} 3 & 5 \\ 2 & 4 \end{bmatrix}$ one obtains eigenvectors..." so that later it makes sense as a self contained document. Or include task statements. No "canonical", "simple", "immediate", "trivial", "of course", etc. Consider using a comment with "%" for WolframAlpha code. Save all school work and assignments.

Reading And Working Through Books
Take notes on definitions, key ideas, and related insights. Consider completionism: solving all tasks, or reading the first line of the solution and contemplating etc. This may be the 2nd best option to Graduate School. Email authors or post on Stack to ask questions.

Reading And Working Through Papers
Imagine insights, experiments, paths, and "how would I have thought of that?" type questions. See the bibliography. Email authors or post on Stack to ask questions.

Writing Papers
Record thoughts, tank, followup ideas, generalisations, can this be generalised? Read extant literature. Use keywords and massive list of citations for bibliography. Hack cross references. Line up many long editing sessions prior to submissions. Perhaps consult friends.

	Habits

Form them. Do homework upon release and go to class 0. I have a library of .pdf and .txt books and on day 0 of courses, copy all deadlines to calendar, perhaps take notes through the entire textbook, set up templates for all homework assignments including correct titling, and compile all readings and film transcripts into .txt files. One can often view past course syllabi when planning, have a .txt file of course numbers and details ready for registration opening time, and use a phone call green button push or dual authentication code once per month on a machine by clicking to remember for 30 days.

	Lifestyle

Sleep, exercise, and diet are all important. What makes one person feel good may not make another person feel good. Breakfast and fruits/vegetables are not necessary. Many would benefit from the energy of eating chicken [rotisserie] fettuccine alfredo, ground grass fed beef, white rice, anything warm, salty, maybe watery which can be rapidly digested and will not cause bloating. Your mileage may vary with 16/8 or 20/4 intermittent fasting. Ensure to eat adequately by once in awhile writing down on Calendar.txt to try modulating upwards. Muscle mass and magnesium relate with carbohydrate uptake and release. One can start off one's day with instant coffee. A 1 per week indoor rowing habit [>70 minutes] can improve memory, cardiovascular strength, sense of wellbeing, baseline hedonic tone. For houses, one can get a free real estate agent, send desiderata, view 20 houses, and pick the one which will be best after 50 hours of optimisation upon moving in.

	Background Malodour Minimisation

Total Time: >50 Hours

Odour particles emanate with various intensities and density curves/latencies of clearance.

In clean air, one ought to feel minimal impulsion to touch nose, effectively clearing out boogies with clean water rinsed fingers perhaps twice per day. Consider plucking nose hairs with fingers at one's risk. Malodour can transfer via chains like hand to doorknobs and later back to hands so ensure to adequately exfoliate fingers skin prior to touching or else induce cognitive dysfunction via transfer into nasal passages. One ought to water wipe squeegee 50 times to remove.

One can nearly wrap a home in aluminum foil, cover walls, create quasi air seals everywhere, hang at door-floor joints, and put everything inside of sealed nearly odourless plastic boxes. Apply tape over cracks and at trim joints. Cover smelly floor from a low height so as to not breathe in minor particles with a thick layer of dry baking soda. Air out once in awhile as needed otherwise malodours can linger in air for quite awhile.

Odour particles pass through cracks in windows, thin walls, fluctuating based upon air pressure deltas, in conjunction with temperature control systems. Taping aluminum foil necessarily involves tape, and thus releases tape/glue fumes into the air. Ensure to fully seal tape leaving 0 exposed ambiently. Air out a place following the application of tape, so as to not get a headache. There may also be off gassing from aluminum foil which takes a little while. I do not think that the 0.01% of non aluminum in my foil is unhealthful, versus the counterfactual.

Alternately, one can consider closely smelling every single thing. This includes every single 6in x 6in square of water wipeable wall.

Cover cabinets in aluminum foil and tape. Floor to counter top, fully sealed, or wall to wall, point to point, nearly sealed. All wooden elements in aluminum foil and tape. Use aluminum foil to cover toilet paper which is malodorous. Cover vent over stove. Slam every window shut with force if needed. Foldy metal tables and plastic boxes for things rather than native cabinets. Holes, outlets, and light switches. Water washing a variety of components near the air conditioning in flow and potentially covering the region between the air filter and the air conditioning unit itself.

Do property damage, remove things, wipe insecticide and chemicals off of sills [this step alone can take >10 hours], ledges, door frames, trims, etc.

One can write: "My air conditioning unit needs maintenance. Either there is a leak in my refrigerant line or the drain, evaporator coil, drip pan, drain line, etc. need to be cleaned." One can examine and water wipe some components. Bring your neighbour "fragrance free" dish soap and other such products with a kind, nice, friendly note, and perhaps $3000 in cold hard cash [neighbours can be douchebags who respond to asks with mala fide harm causing reactions]. To convince apartment managements to care about extant air flow problems, write "I have been suffering cardiovascular arrhythmias and respiratory problems, observed weapons, explosives, powders, chemicals which can be dangerously mixed, and suspect my neighbours of chemical and biological terrorism" to local police and their apartment management as well as your own.

One can obtain a 20 gallon steel pot and stir laundry in boiling water, prior to sunlight drying/airing.

[?] Hydrogen Peroxide

Or air out and clean [pinky or clawer] laundry room at 5am or 6am when 0 neighbours are using it to minimise air in flow malodour transfer during the washing machine's spin cycle. Examine communal washers carefully, and run a baking soda hot water wash cycle [one can really mix around water 5 minutes in to liquidate all around the edges and upper portion of the bowl perhaps] prior to every [[?] 1 cup baking soda] simple hot water wash cycle, followed by drying on rack in apartment or on balcony rather than using a communal dryer where malodour transfer will occur, carcinogenic, causing skin, respiratory problems [certain such products are banned in Western Europe with good reason], cardiovascular arrhythmias, and death via discrete cardiovascular respiratory events.

A litmus test for air cleanliness may be the resolution with which one can smell "authentic" "high resolution" body odour not caused by background malodour but rather air micro biome. Unclear. Other proxies: the resolution and degree with which one smells things e.g. transient minutiae like neighbour's bacon through minor front window cracks e.g. It is possible to thoroughly rinse the mouth following teeth brushing, keep mouth closed, touch nose 0, and feel that one's mouth is relatively clean from 7:00 to 18:30 dinner breakfast. Leave home for a few minutes then enter to perceive background odour prior to norming. It is this sort of thing right here which would strike some coworkers and modern normie psychologists as rather odd or even perhaps lowkey batshit insane but mathematician software engineers as reasonable and reasoned.

Some other general notes about apartment life: one can find the warmest, quietest, location for head of a bed in bedroom, and then light optimise accordingly [black and white card stock paper on window exteriors, aluminum foil can be used in commons facing interiors], or try different locations and discover the optimum. Pooing ought to be relaxed, not tense or muscular, optimal feet legs position, one can use hands on torso, lower torso, totally relaxed to maximise throughput. Given my small stomach and dietary volume, my lower back nearly always feels good regardless.

To navigate remote work with firms, consider trying to find a rhinologist or psychiatrist who will execute a measurement, write down "severe hyperosmia", and will perhaps endorse the notion, if they observe said earplugs [actually, do not wear earplugs during observation, and indicate 0 caffeine usage], that one is habituated and needs them to function and sleep, or that one is a transhuman whose earplugs are a part of one's body legally and medically, and thus one is medically something to be granted 100% remote work so that the firm can process all of that via their usual systems and processes. Write that one has 0 interest in "medication". "Hey doc, I just gotta tell you honestly man that if I were to choose to remove these earplugs... I would go absolutely batshit insane." Record all notes and measurements with doctors and consider revealing 0 about supplements and/or other medications. A doctor may note nearly perfect ears interiors canals, and suggest that iterated exposure to certain smells will improve baseline stress, hedonic tone, and overall functioning. I obtained a written medical record of severe "hyperosmia" on 2022-03-28.

The thing about this is that what can happen is you decrease the background malodour by say 100x but then due to re norming still perceive that it is a source of stress and anxiogenic and can never really always be totally quite sure just how really bad it is objectively. However, frequently shaving the chest and moustache region of hairs is very helpful. If there is nothing more to be done in a suboptimal environment then whining is unproductive. What can be done has been done. And insofar as the hedonic treadmill is concerned, with Rationality one is still reaping the benefits that go along with the cleaner air cognitively.

This again very hyper literally has to do with lived experience so one can be in the kitchen smelling one's testes or whatever and open a bottle of orange juice and immediately be greeted by the overwhelming-almost sharp odour of the orange juice product itself depending on just how low the background malodour is or how one's brain organ is normed and perceiving/reacting to organic and inorganic volatile compounds in the air. Make it more crystal clear here I mean if I pour a glass of orange juice this will maybe like permeate and dominate the apartment.

This is precisely where details about epsilon1 and epsilon2 come in to play, Builder, etc. and say shaving testes leading to a massive first order alteration in bed room background odour.

This form of biological hacking confers downside risks and may be considered to be in the domain of esoteric abnormal experi mental psychology, psychiatry, anti psychiatry, neuro science, neurology, nootropics, cognitive performance hacking, cognition.

I can only suggest some of these actions in good faith once one has assets and perhaps a house with a backup electricity plan for there exists a massive downside risk of things going awry if say the city grid crashes. One may survive very unpleasant scenarios with central nervous system over heating and unwanted sensory input. Koans about mild farts lingering in the air for 10 minutes. Or that matter of instant coffee odour in the air going from the living room through the air in flow in to my bed room.

Semi regularly check the air for mould and consider, depending upon predicted interactions and reactions with home residential environment, using Ozone gas. Evacuate premisses and release for hours and then hold breath while opening windows prior to again evacuating premisses and airing out for 90 minutes.

I still basically endorse selecting a very quiet unfurnished house with a stone floor.

	Teeth Brushing

Rinse with water and thoroughly floss. 1 or 2 large dabs. Thoroughly brush, do not push hard, until everything feels nice and smooth. Brush tongue and around mouth exterior with toothpaste. Wipe completely with clean water finger. Rinse with water whilst scraping tongue with teeth. Rinse with water. Open mouth 0 during the day.

Setup
Extremely important. I run the Visual Studio Code text editor application [see 00 Settings.json] and compile and output in a Google Colab for C++ and Python or Kaggle for R on a 15.6in 1920x1080 Asus Chromebook. Settings in Visual Studio Code are heavily modified rendering it a minimal text editor with hover triggering information to appear [sometimes useful].

Books
Guide To Competitive Programming, Erickson, CLRS.

Chronic Exposure to Notes
I like reviewing my .txt files to refresh my memory and think about algorithms and implementations.

Resources
Competitive Programming Algorithms, Codeforces blogs, Codechef discussions, etc.

Problem Solving
Project Euler, Code Submission Evaluation System, AtCoder, Google Code Jam. When preparing for X, do the contest X archive.

Reading Solutions
Pick tasks with editorials. Read after some time and implement. Read a lot of solutions files too to learn ideas. Look up unknown things and read further references.

Reading Code
Learn better ways of doing things.

Implementation
Do not be scared, practice, and this will be smooth. Use Notebook and modify it for ease of use. Filter by "accepted" and sort by execution time on AtCoder, Codeforces, etc. for performant C++ implementations.

Effective Debugging
Do not just ponder code logic: write print statements! Consider writing a naive implementation, comparing the outputs for variables.
