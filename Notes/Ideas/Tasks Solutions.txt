Variant: make a tricky sub task for each bucket.

Variant: somehow incorporate some tricky polynomials insights

Apples And Buckets

There are n buckets of indistinguishable apples. Your task is to count the number of ways you can select some number of apples in a range.

Input

The first input line has the integer n,a,b: the number of buckets, the minimum allowed, and maximum allowed number of apples.

The next line contains n integers c1,c2,...,cn: the number of apples in each bucket.

Output

Print one integer: modulo 1000000007, the number of ways to select between a and b apples inclusive e.g. the number of n-tuples of nonnegative integers (d1,d2,...,dn) such that 0<=di<=ci and a<=sum di<=b.

Constraints

0<=n<=100000
0<=a,b<=100000
1<=ci<=100000
1<=sum ci<=500000

Example

Input:
4 3 5
2 3 4 5

Output:
90
