Builder


Hi,

I am interested in the construction of an insulated concrete form, concrete exterior and interior house at [land address, near Dripping Springs or Austin, Texas]. I want odourless quiet rooms, including 5 cube rooms with separate air flows and temperature controls. I want odourless, this includes each and every component. If White concrete interior cannot be made quite as odourless as grey concrete interior, then I insist on grey. I am uniquely seriously concerned on this specification, and care about it more than looks. I would like a White ceramic or stone tile floor with 0 Volatile Organic Compound [VOC] grout. I am a bit of a perfectionist, and am interested in discussing each and every component so that I am satisfied with the outcome of this construction project.

White concrete [0 Volatile Organic Compound [VOC] pigment and seal], walls, and ceiling.

All painted elements in washable air purifying 0 Volatile Organic Compound [VOC] White ECOS paint.

In each cube room, 1 thick soundproof large fixed single pane centered window from 2.5ft to 7.5ft and 2.5ft to 7.5ft with minimal White metal frame. A soundproof precise solid White metal door on the left side of the rear wall, and for all doors is important to me.

For temperature control, I want a high power unit[s] running quietly on low power, like a recording studio might. Somewhat far away from the house. With air flow in through the center upper portion of the rear wall without a grill over the vent. Each room with a tight performance hold option thermostat. That is to say, I want a thermostat which will automatically both trigger the air conditioning function in the heat, and the heating function in the cold, without me having to manually toggle between the 2 modes. I want for this to have highly effective air filtering and dehumidifying. If possible, a temperature sensor position near the ground, and connection with the internet so that I may change the temperature in a room from my laptop or iPhone. I want a robust reliable external power generator with automatic backup in the case of a local power outage. I will need all of the components of the air flow structures to be perhaps clean new odourless metal thoroughly deodourised with flowing odourless water [?] mixed with isopropyl alcohol. This is very very critical so that the air I breathe is as odourless as possible. Thus I would like to be assured that the men working on this project will not wear body products and will ensure to wear nearly odourless clothings washed in water for this project as well as not manipulate cigarettes or smelly foods near this construction site.

I do not want any lighting but I do want electricity in each room [6 outlets] [all near the floor opposite the window] and internet [WiFi].

For the other rooms I want a disconnected kitchen/dining room, a living room, and a set of bathrooms with a washing machine closet. And a washing machine which has hot water, and is not efficient.

Set of 2 bathrooms: each with 1 shower [high performance water filter], 1 toilet, and 1 sink with effective ventilation of air to exterior. Including the option to push a button and have a 15 minute timed ventilation fan running.

Kitchen/dining room: [roughly 10ftx10ftx10ft] with a simple sink [high performance water filter] and electricity for a fridge/freezer and electricity outdoors for say an electric grill. All under a solid extended over hang patio. Separate from the main house structure so that air flow is separate. But still a covered walkway so that I can go there during the rains.

Living room: roughly 20ftx20ftx10ft.

I have attached a sketch of a potential property layout. I would also like a simple WiFi enabled finger print door lock for all doors except for the doors in the interior to Cubes 1 and 5 [see attached diagram sketch]. And a tall highly soundproof stone or otherwise wall surrounding the property. As well as electric rotating fully light blocking exterior window covering apparati.

Please let me know if you have any questions and an estimate.

Some esthetic points of reference are also attached of a "minimalist concrete house by Takuro Yamamoto Kanazawa" and a "kubota architect aterlier's 'ho-house' in Japan combines White concrete + frosted glass".

Sincerely,

Lazar Ilic
