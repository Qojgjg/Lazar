Back to this meta idea to try and expose enough of some territory for interested high schoolers, college kiddos, and others... I think perhaps for me an OK strategy would be to not simply copy and paste some Wikipedia links but rather copy and paste some 10000 or so Wikipedia article introductions here in a sequence of sequences so that kids have more of an overview of the territory. It really strikes me that many kids in so called "EECS" departments seem just Earth shatteringly astoundingly weak and ignorant of what I would think constitutes the most basic basic of Electrical Engineering 101isms.

Might be OK looks OK to me.

Confirmed solid in its entirety.
