Sadly, it seems that Scott Duke Kominers and Bloomberg have ended the legendary Kominers's Conundrums column. I have around 10 drafts I pinged him with and here I will add some upon half processing them.

	WEEKENDS!!!

When all is said and done, at the closing bell, the terminating commands, the ending trades, the last buy and sell order executions, we at Bloomberg decided to unwind with a playlist. But, like all good playlist composers and wannabe disc jockeys, we are thinking really hard about the final track! What is it?

1 Incandescent, compact fluorescent, halogen, metal halide, neon, etc.
2 Mi amor.
3 Despite Fisher, I am surprised.
4 Opinions on psychoactive substances? Love?
5 

1 A feline from North India.

3 Sittin' on the grass, layin' side by side rather than chillin' by the fire while we eatin' fondue.
4 I'm you, I'm us, I'm a God.
5 A child who is not quite a rocketman, but is gonna be high.
