Donations


In October 2016 I took the Giving What We Can pledge to donate 10% of my pre tax income on an annual basis.

I regret this. It is not reasonable. One can change and precommitment is nonsense. I am motivated to maintain the pledge because "I want to do what I say I will do" and the ongoing public written record of my membership. I do intend to manage my assets reasonably and donate the vast majority over my living essentials. Hoping to lock retirement soon.

I view many written records, grant writing histories, and further records and intend to donate to:

Berkeley Existential Risk Initiative

I am aware of the existence of many organisations in Effective Altruism, pure maths, 3rd world, medical, climate, and Leftism. I will waste energy and run the Elephant In The Brain "press secretary" a little bit. Andrew Critch is intelligent, relatively lucid, cares about the future in a nontrivially similar way to me, and has a huge edge on me in knowledge of this space, both in terms of people and intellectual content. The graduate students and output of the Center For Human Compatible Artificial Intelligence strike me as mostly solid. On expectation, they will have a large impact on humanity. I intend to post up a half formal verification of my own donations in the spirit of Effective Altruism. I intend to vote Left to the death.
