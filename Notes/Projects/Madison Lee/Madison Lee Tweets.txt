@sweetfernery omg it's deleted now the qt was too powerful
which is impressive considering that whenever i go to his gyms i immediately lose sight of him in the horde of stocky asian guys who are slightly shorter than me
multiple friends who have never met my brother have messaged me like "do you have a brother? is he really strong? i think ive been seeing him in the gym"
@hyperfekt this is exactly the kind of drink i am constantly craving

@ctbeiser @evil_djm i was always interested in him bc descriptions of him convey so much psychological complexity and emotional depth. having feats borne of tension btwn conflicting internal forces... good in my book

@evil_djm he was known as one of the "five good emperors" LOL

@bobpoekert omg you meant social climber my bad
@MCMCD_ omg our diets are trending in perfectly opposite directions... what lies in my future
@bobpoekert why would a climber go east
@araethusa it's really painless
@infinitsummer working on that
@regretmaximizer but then what would i have to complain about!
@mclegibilist so the loneliness is relieved by working on problems connected to the world created and used by real people or
and if that were to happen, what would art mean to me, what would the world be to me, what would be left of me
ive always been deeply curious about others (in a general sense), i feel like i have unanswered questions about them that can't be expressed, i feel like i would have to abandon some of these things to feel even a fraction of the devotion that the innovators i admire possess
@infinitsummer what changed
@mclegibilist sad why
i love to solve cute, hard problems and the people around me enjoy it as well, but they are otherwise alien to me. to me it feels like a diversion, to them it's very important and i can't understand that
true devotion to progress in stem fields seems inherently isolating in nature. it feels like the gap between me and the rest of humanity is broadening as i go deeper in my studies. and there's this persistent sense that i'm ignoring something fundamentally important

@1_800_MIRACLE let me buy u some beers or whatever when u have free time, i promise it'd b painless, i'm charminh enough ?
@sweetfernery ive always felt the same way. so i just ended up with friends who are feminine in non-standard ways or i fulfill a male-friendship role for traditionally feminine women. which feels fine for now
@evil_djm omg i completely forgot about that. you're right i was so sick

@1_800_MIRACLE i think i mitht just be having an episode, i woke up at like 5am for some reason and my skin and hair were lookin better than before and then i exercised and things spiraled out of control from there
@1_800_MIRACLE i think biggest impact things rn are settling into routine for exercise and sleep, reconnecting with people i like, having less imminent deadlines for work. and reflecting on these things has improved ability to focus somewhat
@1_800_MIRACLE eat sleep exercise work read sun friends and family
mostly by changing the last 2
i have achieved temporary bliss by aligning what i think i should be doing with what i want to be doing with what i am doing

@evil_djm you were probably there very early on while my joke brain was developing
@evil_djm LOL this was about my advisor and eli's mom. in this case it's just a joke though i do see them as "other". i think i make a lot of jokes like that bc i had more male followers who would also struggle to make eye contsct with women or volcel etc so everyone made jokes like that
@evil_djm huh how do i describe women
@evil_djm oh yeah ive seen that described as ftf women LOL. and have been described as that. i dont really identify with women but i like the appearance and the power
@evil_djm do you have an example
@evil_djm ive been somewhat masculine in mindset all my life but it never manifested in any particularly gendered interests. is dressing badly a tomboy trait cuz ive done that
@evil_djm my dad is like an edgy redditor and my mom is like a stoic and used to be very tomboyish. my dad is quite charming but antisocial and my mom is a social butterfly but clumsy in her interactions.
@evil_djm me when i findthat i am like my parents in some new way
@evil_djm wait a minute....
@sweetfernery chrysanthemum is really good hot or cold and feels pretty healing.. for a darker richer flavor chicory root blends are also tasty. sometimes i put it in my regular coffee

@apis_GOD ur life a kino
@apis_GOD i started thinking about it frequently after i spotted a guy sitting in his hotel room at the window in the dark looking out at the pool at night when my friend and i were the only ones there
i turn the lights off so that i don't spook anyone whenever i stand at the window and look outside at my neighbors homes and gardens but i imagine it's even spookier in the rare cases where they can see me

@majisukeban you can live my toilet
fuck dont drink beer and work just do it what the fuck am i saying
if i allow myself x then i must do y otherwise i am a degenerate
to be clear i dont drink (1) beer every time i need to work but when i do (with the intention of getting stuff done) i rarely regret it. similar effect probably could be achieved with any other vice though
@djmicrobeads oh yeah skool and research are very low-stakes ymmv
for me it lowers the activation energy necessary to start tasks i particularly dread and usually doing work more slowly is better than doing nothing at all
if you are having trouble starting your work you should drink a beer

@SMOKIN_HOT_RIA i dont actually mean hate i just think the gesture lacks grace idrc if ppl do it or not
@djmicrobeads yes that describes the feeling beautifully it's just like that except usually i mutter something under my breath instead of "telling a joke"
@djmicrobeads the fact that you say them out loud at all is a testament to your generosity and benevolence

it's bad to kill unarmed children
@quonnectum i need to get to the root of this
@TRULY_DOZING thank you for understanding. would that the rest of the world were as humane.
@TRULY_DOZING seems like a weak excuse for them to alienate me. last straw for me was when i cleared my throat and someone started running. i chased after them to demand an explanation but got sent into a coughing fit and couldnt catch up

@BuffGarlicHero lmao nice i didn't think of that when u asked the clarification, it checks out. but given merry's directive, is there ever rly a case where pippin ought to guess the same as well?
@Ookaziyo he's hurting me
@BuffGarlicHero if at least one of them gives the right answer then they're good, so yes they could be released as soon as one gives the right answer: the other response would be redundant info. shouldnt rly matter tho lmao

@jpjamipark they have no way of communicating with each other once they're in the rooms, so
@sgord512 well actually may be useful within the set of suboptimal strategies but it's their lives at stake here so
to be clear they know the outcome of their own flips

@occidentfrank i cant imagine lifting for either
@djmicrobeads me too something primal about it
@djmicrobeads wym other aspects also why curb ur joy
@djmicrobeads i taste it to make sure it's interesting and "good" or if i need to eat but for me eating it doesnt feel incredibly different from eating bland unseasoned food or food cooked by someone else
@djmicrobeads if we solve all the real problems then maybe the true ecstasy of cooking will reveal itself
@djmicrobeads wait.....
@djmicrobeads just introduce meaningless problems to distract from the real ones
@djmicrobeads it's moments like these that make it so appealing... artificial stressors
feeling from feeding loved ones.... seeing them satisfied.... indescribable
also making ppl happy, satisfying need to feed, creating etc
cooking is violent and stressful which is why i like it i think
