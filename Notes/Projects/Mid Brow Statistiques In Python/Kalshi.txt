Might sketch up, draft up some ideations in public for how I might have gone about executing some market making like producing values ab initio or whatever when a new market is being introducted, dunno quite how they decide to go about doing that, with what credences they have, what people want to be trading upon, etc.

But anyways might lowkey just ideate and hope to come back mid latency day by day ping more follow on thoughts just to practice this see my latency see what I could cook up say for this firm in a 1 hour, 4 hour, 8 hour type of timeline for which objects exactly. Dunno just how many markets they expect to be made daily by a Quantitative Researcher Market Maker or just what sorts of R and Python files I would want to be dreaming up. Get more in the mix with real world relevant econometrics metrics perhaps.

Dunno it really matters but obviously of course as a private trader here one could execute some analysis look at different classes sub classes of these instruments try and gain some information track volume and track histories of other traders how things went down with respect to trade timing, information flow, markets open, time of day, presumably quite a few centaurs exist on this platform like genuine just centaurs who do think they have an edge.

Tricky. So this is a canonical deep in Economics 101 territory type of thing and one supposes it has been studied very extensively. They probably already have OK fairly performant models. I uh now am getting more into just surveilling the territories surrounding these Banking datasets. So uh one can view quite a few extant .csv files from the FRED Federal Reserve Economic Data and elsewhere in public.

Might look up some time series stuff on this where the precise location of gas sales was being made compared here. I uh dunno if private firms can get information on this sort of asset via satellite or how much weather actually does hit this a la that Social Network scene. Predicting like usage rates. One might think holidays would have an impact that some other people's models might not capture or estimate which throws in some non trivial factor. I dunno.

At those moments I mean tracking sentiments in public online commentariat is one thing and in like the press articles.

OKOKOK so one can read up on a variety of opinions on the internet and perhaps try and weight them somehow based upon like a literal credential and/or readership/viewership counts so there are some starting ideas. I mean how to judge these sources over time like say we are at some trading firm maybe we eventually discover to try and weight the .txt files generated from the Russia Today website more highly than some other News source I mean I dunno what basket and how they normally process these things in their Natural Language Processing algorithms but I assume when it comes to live Twitter analysis they might actually be pretty half sophisticated I just dunno I dunno what they do at the Two Sigma firm for real for real but I am dying to living to know.
