So I am now like thinking about a screenplays corpus. And a television screenplays corpus. And the Netflix and YouTube to text corpus. And whether or not our Machine Learning algorithms could produce more useful or additionally useful information from those textual corpi. And like trying to give a film a metric based upon how generically Bad-Good the dichotomy duals present in the narrative are or if it is one of those supposedly subtler more value judgement neutrally type of flicks. Furthermore I thought of maybe doing a prediction task in The Big Bang Theory like predict where the laugh tracks were. Something about surprise functions and humour detection. Or intended humour. Unclear. Dark humour. Half interesting stuff really. Genre prediction is OK. Maybe also try and evaluate the neutrality of News sources supposedly.

One can easily Google and skim some lists on top of actual projects other people did to impress firms... such as:

Of course it naturally brings up the question of the actual measurable impact of songs' lyrics on the stock market and like consumer preferences long run. And information we can infer about sponsorships like dunno if Canadian Goose did or did not compensate Lil Uzi Vert, record label, and Maaly Raw, etc.

Perhaps for that Cassandra Xia task of memes generation one could actually try and quantify impact or spreadability and vibe of Leftist United States Of America Democractic Party memes and use this to generate potential ideas for new ones which could perhaps be of course in the mixture with some small sample human feedback report generation loop in the cooking up of viral virulent Dem or Neo Liberal memes for tweens and teens and getting out the vote or whatever.
