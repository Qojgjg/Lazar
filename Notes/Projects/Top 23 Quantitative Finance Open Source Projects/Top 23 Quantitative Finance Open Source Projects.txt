Project mention: Why building profitable trading bot is hard? | news.ycombinator.com | 2022-05-22
If the financial analyst does not have a (possibly piecewise) software function to at least test with backtesting and paper trading, do they even have an objective relative performance statistic? Your notebook or better should also model fees and have a parametrizable initial balance.

For exactly this I use this github.com/polakowo/vectorbt itâ€™s really a powerful tool and you can tons of things with it. Recently the developer decided to maintain it but not adding new features, which from now on will be released on the pro version. However, the free version is still very valuable, incredibly fast and suitable for basic to intermediate tasks.

I would never trust a service like this, but at the same time, I'm curious on how to setup the opposite of their motto: "compete with professional algorithmic traders and hedge funds. coding required!".

Does Fidelity offer an API of some sort so that I can login with my normal credentials and buy/sell? I'm assuming the strategies being used here, like "Ride the Trend", are basically the same ones available here: github.com/enzoampil/fastquant

So, given that the previous statements are true, do I just need some Yahoo! Finance API + FastQuant and then MyBank API to autotrade for myself? What else would be involved?
