Set Insert, Find, Delete: log n

Ordered Set Insert, Find, Delete, Find By Order, Order Of Key: log n

Array Order Statistic: n
	Compute ith smallest element in expected O[n] time using selection rank pivot. Guaranteed O[n] exists, see CLRS.

Extremum On Unimodal Function: log n
	Ternary search.

Query Interval Processing On Static Array: n^[3/2]
	Sort queries into n^[1/2] blocks on left and inside blocks on right and two pointers through.

Monotone Queue
	Deque.

2 Pointers
	And many pointers for a variety of tasks auxiliaries.

Index Compression
	If for example inputs have some numbers in a large range but there are few of them one can form a bijective mapping into a more tenable range for processing.

-------------

Number Of Distinct Values: n
	Hash set size. For e.g. ints in a small range binary appearance vector. Or robust O[n log n] with a set.

Queries Number Of Distinct Values In Each Range:
	mos interval handling with frequency map and counter.

Compute Sum Of Minima Of All a x b Submatrices: nm
	Monotone queue across rows then down columns.
