Diameter, Center[s], Isomorphism: V
	Maximal distance from arbitrary to produce a vertex, maximal distance from that vertex to produce diameter and center[s].

Tree Traversal Array: V
	Also known as Depth First Search in order. With subtree size one can range update and range query with a segment tree for example over subtrees.

Path Queries:
	For example to evaluate the sum from root to node and one can update a value via range updating the subtree using a segment tree on the tree traversal array and query in 1.

Tree Dynamic Programming:
	There exist many tasks, especially on the AtCoder platform, where this technique has been highly useful. Recurse on subtrees or subpaths as needed rather than say a large Heavy Light Decomposition manipulation.

Lowest Common Ancestor: V
	Query: log V

Lowest Common Ancestor: V log V
	Query: 1

Heavy Light Decomposition
	Query Path: log^2 n
	Path Update: log^2 n

To do: a bunch of actual trees decomposition tasks from the United States Of America Computing Olympiad Guide website as well as a variety of systems and platforms like the Facebook Hacker Cup etc. snag cop some performant C++ implementations from there and then add in all sorts of neat little post facto useful commented out lines to uncomment whilst buzzing, blamming, and booming mid round.
