Talk about this real hard hitting stuff sometimes in my Diary the symbolisms and all but the point of the Elder Wand saying Latin spells yadda not lost on me re symbolisms about pens being mightier than swords and the power and meaning of written text... but really when it comes into the pensieve object and the other invocation of memory memoire here the Tom Marvolo Riddle Diary object which is of course the same or nearly the same as the pensieve object anyways that is the point kiddos, get a Diary, close your eyes, and boom you are traveling across time and space back to the start back to the genesis your own abiogenesis, the beginning, and all of the memories keep you here and grounded.
