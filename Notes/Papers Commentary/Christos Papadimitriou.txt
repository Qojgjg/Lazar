One of the Greatest Of All Times. Obviously I have already read many of his papers in the studies of competitive programming but ought to do all the Complexity stuff very seriously here might find an edge there in those domains for litty lit lit research.

	Algorithms

	Computational Complexity

	Combinatorial Optimisation: Algorithms And Complexity

OK like...

	Approximate Nash Equilibria In Anonymous Games

OK paper.

	On The Complexity Of The Parity Argument And Other Inefficient Proofs Of Existence

OK

... come back to this.
