	Estimating Geometry Of Manipulated Objects Via Unexpected Environmental Contact Rachel Gardner

Well her 3rd tooth from the center is quite a lot longer and sharper looking so perhaps it could penetrate neck skin to a full on vampire blood letting bite but in any case she might be pretty sharp too in the noodle noggin. Pretty girl anyways geometric reasoning using vision and touch sounds really really really Good like it would impress firms there are multiple types of inputs and it seems capital I Importante.

	Variable Impedance Control In End-Effector Space: An Action Space For Reinforcement Learning Contact-Rich Tasks

OK.

	Determining Question-Answer Plausibility In Crowdsourced Datasets Using Multi-Task Learning

OK

	Automated Abnormality Detection In Lower Extremity Radiographs Using Deep Learning

OKOKOK seem cool and Good Good.

	CS224N: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning [1 quarter]

Seems like a really Good solid useful helpful course I would strongly advise and suggest Stanford Computer Science majors to enroll in and take seriously.

The Winter 2022 Final Projects are actually rather interesting you know that these Stanford Computer Science majors are not really all so bad or shmuck tier. Lossless Neural Text Compression errm. Natural Language Generation With Adversarial-Free Imitation Learning. A Natural Language Processing Approach To Understanding Patent Acceptance Criteria. Is A Bias Metric Biased? And so on and so on reading the titles is useful and informative as is skimming the literal contents of the projects.
