	Queen Domination Of Even Square Boards

Funny title of course the domination of the queen errm domination of the queens... hip to be square when you give them free room and errm board? Anyways I need to take some Good Notes here to convince the readership that I am focused on the serious work and day by day actions of perusing, stewing, meditating, and brewing on maths rather than dreaming about a dream house and dream girls. First you dream up the Annals paper and then comes all the peenie pee stuff PNP whatever it is kiddos like P P P P pee pee pee pee.
