Cool stuff for the most part in line and aligned with my own interests to some degree.

Hello :]
I'm Vincent, an undergrad at MIT majoring in math and exploring computer science and biology. I'm interested in understanding and improving individual behaviour through both human-centered approaches [eg. introspection, therapy, cognitive science] and technical ones [eg. artificial intelligence, friendly design, brain tech]. In my free time I enjoy working on miscellaneous projects, writing, and meeting new people. Previously, I've worked in crypto, biotech, healthcare, and other roles. I've also participated in communal living experiments such as School 2.0 and math contests such as the IMO. Feel free to reach out if any of the above interests you!
