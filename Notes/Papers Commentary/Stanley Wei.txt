All my ninjas really gang bang, talk that damn slang
Rap about it, do the same thing, let your nuts hang
We gon' pull up, ninja ¡ándale!, on sangre
We post up, we don't do the race, you gon' die today
You can talk hot on the internet, boy
That's that goofy shit, we ain't into that, boy
Black van, pull up to your momma crib, boy
Tie her up, drive that shit off a bridge, lil' boy

Anyways in my eyes Stanley Wei is in fact one of the most serious competitive programmers in the history of UT Austin undergraduates because that Alibaba Final Round really is a competitive programming like theoretical competitive programming like theoretical computer science or something or other in any case maybe this dude will actually go to graduate school, snag a chill PhD, and a nice job and life in academia have some fun with it who knows or exit out to a lucrative Quantitative Research career on the Street.
