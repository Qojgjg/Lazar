Might go do some commentary on the Lex Fridman podcast over in Literature Critically Reading at some point. Some folk benefit from this YouTube to feel less lonely and also think very highly of his Twitter feed for real and like that style of preachy preaching. Robin Hanson is cool cool cool.

Controversial offensive to clock performances measurements of human brain organs on a variety of metrics and like compare them bro... very simple useful powerful O[1] queries of brain organs and where to find them I mean... in like an IQ test or neuro assessment I guess... think this dude's got a pretty biggus whiggus big brain galaxy meme brain organ himself.

"
Here's my conversation with Richard Haier (
@rjhaier
), psychologist specializing in the science of human intelligence. This is a controversial topic, but a critically important one for understanding the human mind.

Anyways remember brother if you get high don't want people thinking you are a dog, a pregnant Chinese mother, or like this dude on the internet boy:

Hit me up any time brother Dottore Lex Fridman we could hang out I could ensure you we chould chit chat yeah yeah yeah nothing weird no punching no deltoids no weird poozles puzzles messing around with noodle noggins...

For me personally I struggle with like competitiveness gone amok weak spot and you know I am like a boundedly rational guy and all so absolutely 0 pool, table tennis, chess, games, board games, puzzles outside of my feed and all for me personally you know stress levels and all of that. I don't consent to no measurements no nothing on the fly I not prepared you know.

I've been getting dirty money; Jordan Belfort
Stacking penny stocks while I'm flipping these birds
Sipping on Ciroc, trip 'em up with the words
I just popped a molly and I think this be my third
Jordan Belfort, Jordan Belfort
I been getting dirty money; Jordan Belfort
Stacking penny stocks while I'm flipping these birds
I just flipped a birdy, money so dirty
Got my bitch a mink, furry like Furby
I came up, made a milly, spent it on a rollie
Stackin gouda, feta, chedda cheese and ravioli
Or maybe fettuccine, dirty martini
I'ma fuck your bitch, call me Houdini
I'm drivin' Lamborghini, your ho in a bikini
Eight bottles to the neck, three wishes from a genie
Benjamin ain't dirty, but these Franklins be filthy
Always going to court, but I'm never pleadin' guilty
Ballin' so hard I only be slam dunkin’
Beat steady rock and the trunk straight thumpin'
I be ridin' foreign, pourin' merlot while I swerve
Pedal to the medal when I'm whippin' round the curb
And I'm rollin' up this marijuana, you can smell the herb
And I be getting all this lettuce, I ain't talkin' iceberg
I've been getting dirty money; Jordan Belfort
Stacking penny stocks while I'm flipping these birds
Sipping on Ciroc, trip 'em up with the words
I just popped a molly and I think this be my third
Jordan Belfort, Jordan Belfort
I been getting dirty money; Jordan Belfort
Stacking penny stocks while I'm flipping these birds
Jordan Belfort, Burberry shirt
LV loafers on my sofa in Bel-Air
Turnin' up daily cause we can't turn down at work
I been lightin' loud lately like my volume switch don't work
And my cologne is Versace, Medusa got me stoned
I'm always high on something, but I usually like to smoke
We been long time friends, me and Ben Frank
Every fucking day he needs a ride home from the bank
Muhfucka, you don't know me, you ain't in my tax section
My wallet ain't fat, it's in the gym straight flexing
I don't call your bitch back and she's checkin' her reception
Bitch with double D's, she's all up on my erection
And I'm in the ovaries, but I ain't about affection
So easily the sober me just smokes and then forgets them
Sometimes this life seems a little stressful
Especially when they tell me that I am something special
I've been getting dirty money; Jordan Belfort
Stacking penny stocks while I'm flipping these birds
Sipping on Ciroc, trip 'em up with the words
I just popped a molly and I think this be my third
Jordan Belfort, Jordan Belfort
I been getting dirty money; Jordan Belfort
Stacking penny stocks while I'm flipping these birds
