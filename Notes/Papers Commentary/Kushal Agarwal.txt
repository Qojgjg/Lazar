I prototyped an audio-based device localization system which used ultrasonic time-of-flight measurements from a 5.1 surround sound setup to achieve <200ms latency and <5cm accuracy. It used cutting-edge research in signal processing and localization, and included both an offline version in Python for research and development and an online Android demo version

I led the team to win 1st place (of 60 teams) at Portland FIRST Regional and qualify for the 2013 FIRST World Championship, the team’s best performance in its 12 year history. I was responsible for the robot our 30+ member team would create. This meant I made critical design trade-off and construction decisions; managed scheduling, parallel projects, lead times, and set-backs; organized meetings and kept them productive; and worked with students, mentors, and our coach so that everyone was on…
