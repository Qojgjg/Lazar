	Machine Learning For Cybersecurity: Network-Based Botnet Detection Using Time-Limited Flows

OK abstract. Wow supervised learning and unsupervised learning. This must really be the realio dealio way to get a firm to care. I should hop right in to the mix and email more professors to co sign me as the legitimate one.

Righto networked devices. Bot network. Right right. Right right technical jargon looks Good. Packet capture. Yadda. Visual. Dataset. Scenarios. Right average importance. Training models. Results right right. t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding t-SNE OK better mem all like this one for later to poop out in interviews wombat style really impress them. OK visualisations. OKOKOK selected 40 features righto. Classifier. Conclusion. Wow and like actual conclusions and a bibliography. Amazing. Awesome. Legendary. Inspired and inspirational.
