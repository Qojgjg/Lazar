Enumeration and Extensions of Word-representants

Authors: Marisa Gaetz, Caleb Ji

Abstract: Given a finite word w over a finite alphabet V, consider the graph with vertex set V and with an edge between two elements of V if and only if the two elements alternate in the word w. Such a graph is said to be word-representable or 11-representable by the word w; this latter terminology arises from the phenomenon that the condition of two elements x and y alternating in a word… ▽ More

Hessenberg varieties associated to ad-nilpotent ideals

Authors: Caleb Ji, Martha Precup

Abstract: We consider Hessenberg varieties in the flag variety of GLn(C) with the property that the corresponding Hessenberg function defines an ad-nilpotent ideal. Each such Hessenberg variety is contained in a Springer fiber. We extend a theorem of Tymoczko to this setting, showing that these varieties have an affine paving obtained by intersecting with Schubert cells. Our method of proof cons… ▽ More

Primes with Beatty and Chebotarev conditions

Authors: Caleb Ji, Joshua Kazdan, Vaughan McDonald

Abstract: We study the prime numbers that lie in Beatty sequences of the form ⌊αn+β⌋ and have prescribed algebraic splitting conditions. We prove that the density of primes in both a fixed Beatty sequence and a Chebotarev class of some Galois extension is precisely the product of the densities α−1⋅|C||G|. Moreover, we show that the primes in the intersection of these sets… ▽ More

On the Distribution of Range for Tree-Indexed Random Walks

Authors: Aaron Berger, Caleb Ji, Erik Metz

Abstract: We study tree-indexed random walks as introduced by Benjamini, Häggström, and Mossel, i.e. labelings of a tree for which adjacent vertices have labels differing by 1. It is a conjecture of those authors that the distribution of the range for any such tree is dominated by that of a path on the same number of edges. The two main variants of this conjecture considered in the literature are the… ▽ More

Distinguishing Numbers and Generalizations

Authors: Caleb Ji

Abstract: The distinguishing number of a graph was introduced by Albertson and Collins as a measure of the amount of symmetry contained in the graph. Tymoczko extended this definition to faithful group actions on sets; taking the set to be the vertex set of a graph and the group to be the automorphism group of the graph allows one to recover the previous definition. Since then, several authors have studied… ▽ More

Brussels Sprouts, Noncrossing Trees, and Parking Functions

Authors: Caleb Ji, James Propp

Abstract: We consider a variant of the game of Brussels Sprouts that, like Conway's original version, ends in a predetermined number of moves. We show that the endstates of the game are in natural bijection with noncrossing trees and that the game histories are in natural bijection with both parking functions and factorizations of a cycle of Sn.

The sieving phenomenon for finite groups

Authors: Caleb Ji

Abstract: The cyclic sieving phenomenon is a well-studied occurrence in combinatorics appearing when a cyclic group acts on a finite set. In this paper, we demonstrate a natural extension of this theory to finite abelian groups. We also present a similar result for dihedral groups and suggest approaches for natural generalizations to nonabelian groups.

On an Algorithm for Comparing the Chromatic Symmetric Functions of Trees

Authors: Sam Heil, Caleb Ji

Abstract: It is a long-standing question of Stanley whether or not the chromatic symmetric function (CSF) distinguishes unrooted trees. Previously, the best computational result, due to Russell, proved that it distinguishes all trees with at most 25 vertices. In this paper, we present a novel probabilistic algorithm which may be used to check more efficiently that the CSF distinguishes a set of trees. App… ▽ More

Enumerative Properties of Posets Corresponding to a Certain Class of No Strategy Games

Authors: Caleb Ji

Abstract: In this paper, we consider a game beginning with a multiset of elements from a group. On a move, two elements are replaced by their sum. This is a no strategy game, and can be modeled as a graded poset with the rank of a node equal to the cardinality of its multiset. We study the enumerative properties of certain variations of this game, such as the number of ways to play them and their numbers of… ▽ More

Chocolate Numbers

Authors: Caleb Ji, Tanya Khovanova, Robin Park, Angela Song

Abstract: In this paper, we consider a game played on a rectangular m×n gridded chocolate bar. Each move, a player breaks the bar along a grid line. Each move after that consists of taking any piece of chocolate and breaking it again along existing grid lines, until just mn individual squares remain. This paper enumerates the number of ways to break an m×n bar, which we call chocolate… ▽ More
