research interests
My research interests are in probability and its applications to machine learning and high-dimensional statistics. Recent work has focused on:

random matrices, free probability, and applications to high-dimensional statistics
probabilistic and representation theoretic approaches to conformal field theories
robustness and data augmentation for neural networks
learning theory for multi-reference alignment and cryo-EM
