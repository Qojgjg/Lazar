Uh pretty interesting set of repositories.

Starts to make me think and notice that like a ton of people who get hired on the Street actually have a ton of repos and maybe I should like pay much more close attention to composing papers and/or whatever it is that people like Coding Jesus say are their step by step instructions to getting a job on the Street if I want to sign here next 30 or 60 days or what goes down in my systems and processes here shortly.
