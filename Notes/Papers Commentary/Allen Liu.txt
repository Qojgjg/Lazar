OK legendary legend.

I am currently a first-year graduate student in Electrical Engineering And Computer Science at MIT working under the wonderful supervision of Ankur Moitra. I also completed my undergraduate degree [in Mathematics] at MIT. I am generally interested in algorithms and learning theory, particularly developing algorithms for machine learning with provable guarantees. My work is supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship and a Hertz Fellowship.
