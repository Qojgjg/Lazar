Really cool smart sharp dude, nice of him very friendly to go hang out with some donkey donk dorky high schoolers at the United States Of Amerika Computing Olympiad summer camp and uh... funny YouTube presence, funny LessWrong presence, funny dude I bet he is super duper wooper sharp and productive there at the Jump Trading firm and is perhaps more Profit/Loss generating overall than the brother Cody Johnson but who can ever know for sure anyways in any case I just got smashed on that Codeforces round whoops oops and then got double smashed whammied on that Project Leonhard Euler round should have a 7 minute latency there rather than 30 so... uh I gotta get to crack a lacking and work on my Competitive Programming game here next 60 days if I need to really study C and C++ very deeply prior to Meta Hacker Cup try and get in the money somehow I am feeling like CP and Software Engineering is the route for me like I dunno I dunno I dunno if I can execute 5 predictions, time series forecasting tasks and then rep represent those as projects valid legitimate statistiques in order to try and snag DRW, Jump, Citadel, or like Two Sigma Quantitative Researcher roles or if I needs maths papers. And it is whatever bro because bro bro bro I really put the work in don't you ever try to play me so I can chill work 18 hours per day and if my latency a little slow so be it light it up with some litty lit lit Software Engineering projects here next 60 days and someone will sign me for Software Engineer or Software Developer. The more I cook up the lower the latency will be in any case and soon I might be booming back in to the Project Leonhard Euler Eulerian Top 25 on the leaderboard...
