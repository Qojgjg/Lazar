OK

Legendary legend.

Strong Notes, strong massive corpus, some weak stuff.

	Ecne: Automated Verification Of Zero Knowledge Circuits

OK solid one.

	Recommending With Recommendations

OK solid one. Wish I was there hanging out with Scott Duke Kominers ideating and getting co signs on papers like such as this one.

	Intrinsic Gradient Compression For Federated Learning

OK

	Monodromy Groups Of Indecomposable Rational Functions

This the paper that got it all popping off. This dude is a fucking legendary legend of the Fall, Winter, Spring, and Summer and a real esthete to boot. Legendary legend.

	FranklynWang.com

Just an OK website.

The Papers section is very interesting.

The Courses section is half interesting but some of the content is mediocre frankly in my perception and was a big update for me in the direction of like Franklyn Wang, Siye Zhu, and Jacob Klegar are much less impressive than I thought and I cannot really be that sure how impressive a Master Of Science In Computer Science degree from Harverd is really but I do not want to cringe until I myself have a PhD or Master Of Science degree and can contemplate and comprehend what precisely it was that I contemplated or supposedly comprehended I mean I ought to read like 1000 books on Software Engineering here shortly and really Truly become the best me me I can be... become the Rank 1 Lazar Ilic Software Engineer in the whole wide world universe.

	Respect for Improvements via Matching with Contracts

OK solid one.

	An Accurate and Scalable Subseasonal Forecasting Toolkit for the United States

OK pretty interesting this relates sort of to those Kalshi tasks from earlier.

	Intrinsic Gradient Compression Algorithms for Federated Learning

Cool cool yeah yup yup.

	Recommending with Recommendations

See above if I actually comment upon this one.

	Putting the "Learning" into Learning-Augmented Algorithms for Frequency Estimation

OK

	Generalization by Recognizing Confusion

	Optimizing reserves in school choice: A dynamic programming approach

OK whatever yeah yeah yup yup.

And Courses.
