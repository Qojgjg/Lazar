Gee I mean in terms of me and right now doing some C++ studies and some Quantitative Research studies man when I think back to like smiling and Caltech and odd utterances on like the topics of physiology re human males and e.g. mid distance running and nutrition and stuff I kind of cringe I mean the whole domain is odder than odd and brain organs are not well understood and I would rescind any sort of weird unclear claims about serum hormones basically I mean I know some stuff now but uh still comes back into that story I told yesterday about me and my own life and experiences with which precise drugs and what and so on and so on.
