Fascinating dude "bona fide hustler" net worth estimates are unclear, but he wrote a book, has some assets, a net worth > 0, very very cool stuff to do prior to engaging in being a pure mathematiques graduate student especially in Cambridge I dunno he seems very content and minimal kind of a lifestyle probably a relatively mellow, chill, dude not too prone to extreme sensory agitations and anxieties man oh man. 300lb big dude. Maybe he is lowkey friends with the one and only competition Mehtaab Sawhney. These dudes are pretty lifted, gifted, and fly.

Up front it is like Scientific Computing is an extremely exquisitely fascinating domain and my fantastic professor Joe Kileel here at The University Of Teas At Austin provided us with ample auxiliary readings on the course material. Errm. You know like these actual equation solving, system of linear equations solving, linear algebra, computational algorithms stuff is seriously cool cool cool.

	Thesis: Graphs, Principal Minors, And Eigenvalue Problems

Let us see here for a skim. 2.3.3 An Algorithm For Principal Minors With Noise is important. Yikes finally we on the spectrum finally I know what the spectrum is we on the spectral equivalence. I see Cauchy-Schwarz in literally every single not literally OK tons of maths papers. Yikes and I kind of bounce out struggling to care right now about these precise topics.

	On The Characterisation And Uniqueness Of Centroidal Voronoi Tessellations

This is worth examining at a later date perhaps these topics are very interesting objectively.

	Tackling Graph Theory | The Cartesian Cafe With Timothy Nguyen

Solid topics solid publicity solid talks.
