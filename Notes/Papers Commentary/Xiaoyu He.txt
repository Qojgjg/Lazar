OK dude totally wack Wrong stuff on his web log. Whatver.

Fascinating fun little introduction reminding the readership of a variety of canonical invocations of these and related tasks.

Uh yeah I mean I guess this is pretty like Duluth REU tier or Putnam tier frankly I could try and pop something of this calibre and complexity out here very shortly soon would really boost my imago with legitimate people at firms as well as perhaps with Messieur Dottore Joe Gallian himself and like David Rusin et al.

Solid solid solid paper very solid interesting one for me to read up further readings and maybe pop back to this later contemplate these sorts of things.

OKOKOK see this is the thing I maybe need to ease up for the day settle down and stew brew mull contemplate a little further what sorts of maths I do here or if I line up either some statistics projects implementations or some performant C++ codes to impress firms one or the other I cannot dedicate myself to maths papers entirely I need to produce at least 1 or 2 impressive projects in the next 60 days for sure if I do not sign right here right now.
