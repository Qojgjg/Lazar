I am 35 years old, retired, and live in a house named "IO". I want to reproduce soon and home school our children. I enjoy a simple lifestyle and like intelligent 23-26 year olds with low anxiety and high libido, especially STEM graduate students [>50 citations] and those with a strong background in maths competitions [Gold Medal, >= 11 on the AIME].
