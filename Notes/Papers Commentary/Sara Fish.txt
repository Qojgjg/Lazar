Solid writing. Solid expository writings too. Frankly again this human would get instantly rejected by many firms for totally fucking flagrantly lying and misrepresenting herself in a clear violation of United States Of Amerika contract law for there was no Putnam 2020 actually and this is really dishonest and disingenuous. The LaTeX thing was half interesting too.

I am a math major at Caltech, expected graduation date June 2022.

My research interests are in discrete mathematics, theoretical computer science, interactive/automatic theorem proving, and machine learning, especially where they intersect.

My (academia oriented) CV.

Feel free to email me at sfish at caltech dot edu.

In summer 2021, I was a counselor at PROMYS, a TA for Caltech's Math 0, and a mentor at the Polymath Jr. REU.
In Fall 2020 - Spring 2021, I took a year off from undergrad to do research in geometric group theory and then ML/AI.
In summer 2020, I did combinatorics research with David Conlon through Caltech's SURF program.
In summer 2019, I participated in the SMALL REU at Williams College.
In summer 2018, I worked as a JC at Canada/USA Mathcamp and participated in the CUNY Combinatorics REU.
I enrolled at Caltech in Fall 2017.

I wrote an interactive LaTeX Tutorial (July 2021). I used it to teach a LaTeX minicourse at PROMYS, and it was also used in Caltech's summer course Math 0.
