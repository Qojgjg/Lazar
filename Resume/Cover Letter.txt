I am extremely passionate about learning, doing the day by day actions of building value for a firm, and working hard. I like statistics, machine learning, computer science, data, mathematics, contemplating, and ideating.

I would strongly prefer to be remote or mostly remote. I might like to have my own office with a standing desk. If this is not convenient, then perhaps a desk such that my back is to a wall so there are not sounds or people walking behind me, or too far in my periphery.

[This is drafting. As an aside and afterward for my brothers and sisters out there in offices one can consider wiping monitours, keyboards, and desks with water and nice towels. See Productivity.txt for further information. I am not a domain expert on flooring or overall air control in office settings and spaces.]
